# [Q]uantum open system within [optical] regime
A framework to perform GPU computations on certain open quantum systems
within optical regime. A highly optimized integrator of the [optical master equation][1] is implemented.

A [QuTip][1] based integrator defines a reference implementation. The optimized integrator is based on OpenCL in order to perform integration on the GPU where a matrix element of the density operator is represented by a work-item. The OpenCL kernel was further optimized while the existing unit tests enhanced confidence that each iteration did not break the code.

For further details, [checkout the repository of my master thesis][3].
